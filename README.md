## Building a basic version of PayTM

## Things to improve on
1. adding pfp(initials of firstName+lastName) on users list(in dashboard) and logged in user(at the top right corner)
2. creating a drop down menu for the logged in user showing following option
    - firstName, lastName, username
    - option to logout(clear the token)
3. filtering out the logged in user from the users list in dashboard
